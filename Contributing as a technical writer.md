## Contributing to publications as a technical writer

You can contribute by writing for a few publications. Though you wouldn't be paid, you get visibility and a chance to share your knowledge with a broader audience while being recognized as a subject matter expert. The best part is that most of these publications have in-house editors, so you get better at writing. 

For paid opportunities, please check out the [getting paid session](https://github.com/Bennykillua/Getting-started-in-Technical-Writing/blob/main/README.md)
