## How to make a Pull Request (PR)

This guide was a modification of the [Microsoft 365 Platform Community Blog: How to contribute guide](https://pnp.github.io/blog/post/contribute-blog/)

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

1. Create a Git (not GitHub) account

   * Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code
   * Type `git --version` in a directory of your choice - you should see the version of Git that you downloaded. If you see an error, close and reopen VS Code and try again.
   * Set your user name with 
   `git config --global user.name "<your-first-name> <your-last-name>"` - replace the `<placeholders>` with the real values
   * Set your email address with 
   `git config --global user.email "<your-email-here>"`- replace the `<placeholder>` with the real values (your email address should match the one with which you signed up for your GitHub account)

1.  Fork this repository to create a copy in your GitHub account:

    * Open [Bennykillua/Getting-started-in-Technical-Writing](https://github.com/Bennykillua/Getting-started-in-Technical-Writing) (this repository)
    * Select **Fork** 
    * Make a [Fork](https://github.com/Bennykillua/Getting-started-in-Technical-Writing/fork] --> The URL of your fork is now `https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT>/blog/`

8. Commit and push your changes to your fork

Whenever you want to upload your changes to your remote fork:

* type `git add .` (yes, there is a space (` `) between `add` and the `.`) - this adds all changes to staging area
* type `git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"` - this will commit your changes with the messages
* type `git push` to push the changes to your remote fork

9. Pull request

You will now want to (kindly) ask the repository maintainers to pull in your changes. You do that with a pull request:
