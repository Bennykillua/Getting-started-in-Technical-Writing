# Docs as Code, documentation, APIs, and everything in between

You can find documentation courses [here](https://github.com/Bennykillua/Getting-started-in-Technical-Writing/blob/main/Technical%20Writing%20Courses.md)

## Docs as Code

Docs-as-code refers to handling your documentation the same way programmers handle code. This method is ideal for technical teams since everyone creates documents using the same tools, procedures, and workflows that they utilize while developing software.

It comprises of and is not limited to 
- Version control using Git
- collaboration and review
- Consistent design.
- Automated testing, building, and delivery.
- Issue tracking.
- Use of plain-text markup (Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc).
