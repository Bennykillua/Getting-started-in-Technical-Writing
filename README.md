# What is Technical Writing ?

One of my favourite explanations of technical writing comes from [Tom Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomjoht/), who defines it as the interaction of simplicity and complexity.

I'd define technical writing as a form of writing where the author discusses a specific topic that calls for direction, instruction, or explanation.

To learn more about technical writing, explore the [resources](https://github.com/Bennykillua/Getting-started-in-Technical-Writing/blob/main/Technical%20Writing%20Resources.md)
