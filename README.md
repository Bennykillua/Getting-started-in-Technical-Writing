# What is Technical Writing?

One of my favorite explanations of technical writing comes from [Tom Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomjoht/), who defines it as the interaction of simplicity and complexity.

I'd define technical writing as a form of writing where the author discusses a specific topic that calls for direction, instruction, or explanation.
